# primes
RC2014 BASIC - Sieve of Eratosthenes prime number generator

Primes.bas: The 32K RAM RC2014 Classic ][ has enough memory to generate the prime numbers between 2 and 7,842 using this algorithm.

Primes2.bas: A different implementation, approximately 50% slower than Primes.bas for finding the primes up to 7,500, but capable of finding all the primes up to 65,000ish with the array size specified (255, so that the code will run with minimal changes on a Sharp MZ-80K running BASIC SP-5025).
